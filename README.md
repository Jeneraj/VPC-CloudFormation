# VPC-CloudFormation
Deploys a VPC through CloudFormation


CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service within AWS. Infrastructure as Code is a way of building your architecture using a particular coding language where you deploy your applications using code written in either JSON or YAML. With IaC you can speed up your resource deployment, and CloudFormation will provision your resources in a safe, repeatable manner, allowing you to build and rebuild your infrastructure and applications without having to perform manual actions or risk misconfiguring something.
